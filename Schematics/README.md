## Dome
The Dome has since had the battery pack and RF module removed. Also, a hardwire connection from the body has been added for power and serial.

## Body
The body has had the RF module removed, and we are now using the previously unused power from the 5v DC-DC buck converter to power the dome. Additionally, We added a USB-Serial adapter between the body and dome. Both the power and serial are routed through the slip-ring.
